 In the hospitality industry, managing
 occupancy rates and demand is a complex
 challenge. Hotels struggle with accurately
 predicting room bookings, often leading to
 inefficiencies in staffing, revenue losses,
 and guest dissatisfaction. Traditional
 methods for forecasting demand lack
 precision, failing to adapt to rapidly changing
 market dynamics and customer behavior
 patterns.
 Hoteliers need a reliable and data-driven
 solution to optimize room availability, pricing
 strategies, and guest experiences. The
 absence of an accurate predictive model
 results in overbookings, underutilized
 resources, and financial instability.
 Additionally, the industry faces pressure to
 enhance customer satisfaction while
 maintaining profitability, making it
 imperative to balance supply and demand
 seamlessly.
 Customers and travelers find it incredibly
 difficult to book rooms in advance due to lack
 of availability of occupancy rates. Having an
 idea about the volume of bookings gives
 customers a clear understanding and helps
 them in planning their journey seamlessly. 
The need for a sophisticated machine
 learning model is crucial to align occupancy
 rates with market demands, ensuring hotels
 maximize revenue, enhance operational
 efficiency, and provide exceptional guest
 services. Addressing this challenge requires
 developing an advanced, adaptable, and
 user-friendly predictive model that
 empowers hotel managers to make informed
 decisions, driving the hospitality sector
 towards sustainable growth and customer
centric operations
